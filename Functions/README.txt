Here are the scripts to perform:
  - Extraction and refinement of curve regulation information from data
  - Preprocessing (Filtering, adding KEGG pathway information, and much more)
  - Run Recommender System
  
  - Recommend curves and inspect recommended curves
  - Inspect drug- and peptide-embeddings
  - Contruct heatmap to see similarities of KEGG-pathways or effect of kinase-inhibition
